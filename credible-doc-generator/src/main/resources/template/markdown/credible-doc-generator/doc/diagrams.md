# Examples of PlantUML diagrams generated by the `substitution-core` library

## Activity diagram
After launching the application generates a log file in the `log` directory.
This log file is a recording of the tool behavior and can be used as a documentation source.

As an example the current page uses its own `credible-doc-generator.log` log
file for UML diagrams generation.

This diagram shows the first steps the application performs after launching.

&&beginPlaceholder {
    "className": "com.credibledoc.substitution.doc.module.substitution.launching.LaunchingUmlReportService",
    "description": "Diagram of the application launching created from credible-doc-generator.log.",
    "parameters": {"sourceFileRelativePath": "log/credible-doc-generator.log"}
} &&endPlaceholder

The previous diagram is shorter than the next one because the log file is short.

If we will launch the application more times then more log files will be created,
for example `credible-doc-generator_1.log`, `credible-doc-generator_2.log` and so on, as
configured in `src/main/resources/logback.xml` file. The following diagram is
generated from `credible-doc-generator_1.log` file and contains behavior from previous
launching. This diagram is longer because the generator loaded the whole
log file generated during the previous launching.

&&beginPlaceholder {
    "className": "com.credibledoc.substitution.doc.module.substitution.launching.LaunchingUmlReportService",
    "description": "Diagram of the application launching created from credible-doc-generator_1.log.",
    "parameters": {"sourceFileRelativePath": "log/credible-doc-generator_1.log"}
} &&endPlaceholder

### Activity diagram with swimlanes
This Activity diagram shows main steps of the application activity parsed from a
credible-doc-generator_1.log file. 

&&beginPlaceholder {
    "className": "com.credibledoc.substitution.doc.module.substitution.activity.ActivityUmlReportService",
    "description": "Diagram of the previous application launching.",
    "parameters": {"sourceFileRelativePath": "log/credible-doc-generator_1.log"}
} &&endPlaceholder

### Modules - based activity diagram
This diagram shows the application activity divided to swimlanes. Each swimlane
represents a module and each square element represents an event in the module.
This diagram is generated from parsed credible-doc-generator_1.log file.

&&beginPlaceholder {
    "className": "com.credibledoc.substitution.doc.module.substitution.activity.modules.ModulesActivityUmlReportService",
    "description": "Credibledoc modules - based activity diagram generated from credible-doc-generator_1.log.",
    "parameters": {"sourceFileRelativePath": "log/credible-doc-generator_1.log"}
} &&endPlaceholder

### Dependencies between packages
&&beginPlaceholder {
    "className": "com.credibledoc.substitution.content.generator.dependency.PackageDependenciesContentGenerator",
    "description": "Dependency of the `com.credibledoc.substitution.doc` package on other classes in the `com.credibledoc.substitution` package.",
    "parameters": {
        "sourceRelativePathsPipeSeparated": "credible-doc-generator/src/main/java",
        "dependantPackage": "com.credibledoc.substitution.doc",
        "dependenciesPackagesPipeSeparated": "com.credibledoc.substitution",
        "ignoreInnerPackages": "true"}
} &&endPlaceholder
