# Examples of PlantUML diagrams generated by the `substitution-core` library

## Activity diagram
After launching the application generates a log file in the `log` directory.
This log will be used as a recording of the tool behavior. Application uses its
own `credible-doc-generator.log` for generation of UML diagrams like this one, see below.

This diagram shows the first steps the application performs after launching.

This diagram is shorter then the next one because the application generated a part
of log file only when it loaded this log file.

If you will launch the application more times then more log files will be created,
for example `credible-doc-generator_1.log`, `credible-doc-generator_2.log` and so on, as
configured in `src/main/resources/logback.xml` file. The next diagram is
generated from `credible-doc-generator_1.log` file and contains behavior from previous
launching. This diagram is longer because the application loaded the whole
log file generated during the previous launching.

### Activity diagram with swimlanes
This Activity diagram shows main steps of the application activity parsed from a
credible-doc-generator_1.log file.

### Modules - based activity diagram
This diagram shows the application activity divided to swimlanes. Each swimlane
represents a module and each square element represents an event in the module.
This diagram is generated from parsed credible-doc-generator_1.log file.
