# Module log-combiner-doc
This module generates a documentation for the
[log-combiner](../README.md) repository.
This document is also generated by this `log-combiner-doc` module.

## Usage
Please open a command line and try the next commands in a temporary folder.

Clone this project from Github

    git clone https://github.com/credibledoc/log-combiner.git

Change directory

    cd log-combiner
    
Build by Maven
    
    mvn clean install

Change directory
    
    cd log-combiner-doc
    
Launch the application

    cd log-combiner
    mvn clean install
    java -jar target/log-combiner-doc-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

As a result, the `target/generated/markdown` folder with new folders and files
is generated.

Please inspect these generated files in the `log-combiner-doc/target/generated/markdown` folder.
These generated files is the documentation you are currently reading. You can use
this approach for generation of documentation for your own projects.

## Templates used for generation of this documentation
This documentation is generated from these templates:

* [/template/markdown/doc/log-combiner-core/doc/usage.md](src/main/resources/template/markdown/doc/log-combiner-core/doc/usage.md)
* [/template/markdown/doc/log-combiner-core/README.md](src/main/resources/template/markdown/doc/log-combiner-core/README.md)
* [/template/markdown/doc/log-combiner-doc/README.md](src/main/resources/template/markdown/doc/log-combiner-doc/README.md)


As you can notice, this generated document and its template have common parts,
and this diff shows different parts. These different parts are placeholders (at the left side)
and the content generated from these placeholders (at the right side).
