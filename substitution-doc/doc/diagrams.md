# Examples of PlantUML diagrams generated by placeholder-substitution tool

## Behavior of the application
After launching the application generates a log file in the `log` directory.
This log will be used as a recording of the tool behaviour. Application uses its
own `substitution-doc.log` for generation of UML diagrams like this one, see below.

This diagram shows the first steps the application performs after launching.

If you will launch the application more times then more log files will be created,
for example `substitution-doc_1.log`, `substitution-doc_2.log` and so on, as
configured in `src/main/resources/logback.xml` file. The next diagram is
generated from `substitution-doc_1.log` file and contains behavior from previous
launching.

This Activity diagram shows main steps of the application activity parsed from a
log file.
