# Examples of PlantUML diagrams generated by placeholder-substitution tool

## Behavior of the application
After launching the application generates a log file in the `log` directory.
This log will be used as a recording of the tool behaviour. Application uses its
own `substitution-doc.log` for generation of UML diagrams like this one, see below.

This diagram shows the first steps the application performs after launching.

&&beginPlaceholder {
    "className": "org.credibledoc.substitution.doc.module.substitution.launching.LaunchingUmlReportService",
    "description": "Diagram of the application launching.",
    "parameters": {"sourceFileRelativePath": "log/substitution-doc.log"}
} &&endPlaceholder

If you will launch the application more times then more log files will be created,
for example `substitution-doc_1.log`, `substitution-doc_2.log` and so on, as
configured in `src/main/resources/logback.xml` file. The next diagram is
generated from `substitution-doc_1.log` file and contains behavior from previous
launching.

### Activity diagram
This Activity diagram shows main steps of the application activity parsed from a
log file.

    "description": "Diagram of the previous application launching.",
    "parameters": {"sourceFileRelativePath": "log/substitution-doc_1.log"}
} &&endPlaceholder
